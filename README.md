# Interactive Web Demo Project

## Monash University Masters of Interaction Design

This material created and shared to support Internt-of-Things
related project work.

## How to Start with This

The main content is hosted as a GitHub page on this project
to demonstrate how this works for mobile and computer.

Where possible, most of the interaction is built using CSS
as this gets the best performance from web browsers.
